      <h3><b>PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></h3>
        <p><b>Aiden Gelsthorpe s3700390:</b> My name is Aiden Gelsthorpe, I was born in Kettering, Northamptonshire, England and moved to VietNam in 2008 (13 years living as an expat). I am a final year bachelors degree student, studying digital media at the RMIT University Vietnam. My strengths lie in Web design as well as User Interface and Experience design, but I have capable skills across a wide range of design mediums such as sound design, 3d design, video editing and post production processes and photography. In my own time, I like to care for animals, watch movies, and my guilty pleasure is video games. I have played through a huge variety of games since I started playing as a child, and enjoy picking apart the mechanics of each game and researching why certain games have become more popular in today's advanced technological society. My ideal career would be to work as a user experience designer for large software corporations or video game development companies, working towards my ultimate goal of opening my own design studio.
        </p>
        <p><b>Huynh Hong Nhan s3891846:</b> My name is Huynh Hong Nhan, I am 20 years old this year, and currently I am a freshman studying information technology (IT) at RMIT University. I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City, I am a person who loves to find and explore new things. Regarding my hobby, I am a person who loves to play and experience many different game genres, such as Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) and action adventure. In addition to playing games, football is also one of the things I play in my free time. It is a fact about me that after graduating from high school I was not completely interested in IT even though I knew it a few years ago. However, after 1 year of studying English at the school, I consulted and participated in career guidance classes, I gradually became more interested in it and decided to choose IT. Therefore, my experience in IT is not much, but I always learn more outside to develop more about it.
        </p>
        <p><b>Ly Kien  Dat s3886334:</b> My name is Ly Kien Dat. My student number is S3886334.I am a first-year Information Technology student at RMIT University. During that period, I've been gaming as a hobby so many games such as GTA, CS.GO, FIFA, Need For Speed ​​and others are acquainted with me. Furthermore, I have spent most of my time supporting my family business. There was the fact that the electronic devices surprised me when I used them at the age of 12. Tons of questions come to my head like “ Wow , are there games on the computer?” ,
        “Wow, How can people call or text or even play games on such a tiny phone ? How did they do that?”
        Maybe the majority who are younger than me think that is just a normal, simple question but these questions have changed my entire life which drew me into the technology industry. Until now, I still want to know how these machines work and how they function. I may not have much experience in this field but I will try to learn to improve myself day by day.
        </p>
        <p><b>Nguyen Anh Kiet Anh Tien Gary s3635033:</b> My name is Nguyen Anh Kiet Anh Tien Gary and I am currently in my final year in RMIT studying for my Bachelor in Business management. My Student ID is S3635033, I enjoy being active but also enjoy playing lots of video games or watching YouTube videos on topics that interest me such as conspiracy theories, paranormal and crime stories. I was born in France and came to Vietnam when I was 4 years old. I studied in a public French school and international school until I graduated high school.  I am able to speak 3 different languages, which are English, French and Vietnamese. Last year I opened a Jiu Jitsu club on campus with my friend, which we both are coaching. The IT world interests me due to its forever evolving nature. This has been from watching how video game graphics have evolved over time which can be traced by looking at the game graphics evolution of the PS1 to the PS5, this is notable in games that have sequels such as the Yakuza game series. Another reason I have an interest in IT is that technology has changed the way we do things. One of them would be in the production of movies such as Jurassic Park in 1993. Steven Spielberg specifically wanted lots of animatronics to do stop motion animation for the dinosaurs, however there were issues with one of the animatronics due to filming a scene in the rain, however the scene was saved due to the use of CGI. Although ‘less than half of the 14 minutes of footage containing dinosaurs in Jurassic Park used CGI’(Renee 2016, para. 5.), this allowed the movie to ‘earn an Oscar and it ushered cinema into a new age of digital technology’(Renee 2016, para. 3.). Furthermore, I believe some IT knowledge would open more doors for my career path even though I am studying Business Management.
        </p>

      <h3><b>GROUP PROCESSES</b></h3>
        <p>The group process was pretty straightforward, Aiden worked on the website, week 1 paragraph and contributed with ideas input. Gary contributed to the ideas input and did most of the report. Nhan wrote the overview topic and week 4 paragraph. Dat wrote the motivation and week 2 paragraph. There was no communication and cooperation from Dat and Nhan, they just worked together when they wanted to and waited for Aiden and Gary to put ideas for them to write about. Overall there are no improvements that can be made since Dat and Nhan refused to respond to Gary and Aiden when they were asked to contribute in meetings.
        </p>

      <h3><b>CAREER PLANS</b></h3>
        <p>After reviewing everyone’s assignment 1, we can presume that most of the group members want to become a developer being either a full stack developer, game developer, UI designer or UX designer. Although there are some differences between the jobs, they all can be interconnected. A full stack developer is required to be knowledgeable about the front and back ends of a product and work on it from its primary stage to its end stage making sure that each stage is worked on optimally. UI and UX designers can be argued to be similar to full stack developers since they are fields of work that complement each other. UI designers work on the visuals of their products meaning that they design their products to be visually appealing and easy to navigate through for the end users. The UX designers will focus on enhancing user experience of the end users based on the visual designs of the UI designers. The term game designer is pretty broad as it does not specify which aspect of the game is being worked on. Therefore, our group member Gary has decided that he would prefer to be a game content designer, instead of working on the IT aspects. He would mostly be focusing on the game's storyline aspect. However, knowing the required languages and IT skills to develop a game should be additional skills to learn in order to widen his options in the game design industry. Looking further into these ideal job options, we can observe that they have some similarities.  One of the main skills required would be knowledge of a coding language, these can range from HTML and CSS, Python, JavaScript or C++. Outside of IT, these jobs also encourage us to use our creativity such as web design or creating a story. Although the jobs differ in the way that each job has different focuses all these jobs complement each other.

    <h2 id="project"> Project Description </h2>
      <h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4>
        <p>First of all, what is a sandbox genre? Game Sandbox is a genre of video games characterized by an element of creativity that allows players to freely roam around in a virtual environment to do whatever they like, from how to approach quests, NPCs or ways to Complete both main and side quests. A game that cannot be ignored when it comes to the sandbox MMORPG genre is Skyrim. Based on this format we have incorporated into the open world game to create a multiplayer world. For this project, we used the Unreal Engine to design a 3D world, a 3D world that can help people experience both real and unreal. We have built interactive systems in the game so that players have a smooth experience, for example when the player moves into the bushes will affect the bushes to move, or when the player moving into places with water will create waves. Although these are just small details, they also contribute to improving the game quality and creating a feeling for the player. We attach great importance to player-vs-player (PvP) and player-vs-environment(PvE) mod. First, the PvE mode is a mode where the player battles against creatures such as monsters, Bosses, quests and campaigns. For the MMORPG genre, PvE mode will usually be the main mode of the game, based on this we have created weekly events where players can find and destroy Bosses. After destroying them, the player has a chance to get rare or extremely rare items. In addition, PvP mode is a mode where player-versus-player battles occur, instead of fighting against computer-controlled opponents, players will fight each other in an event where players can show their skills. This mode gives everyone engaging battle scenes between players, however, for the MMORPG genre, players prefer PvE mode over PvP mode. That's why we have created a monthly event system where players can fight each other and after defeating all the winners will get the emulation title. We also built a sub-mode to help players have interesting experiences, the transition from first-person to third-person and vice versa. The benefit of first-person perspective is that it provides a more challenging gameplay experience that relies heavily on goal and skill to win the game. But it gives a realistic experience because you are the character yourself. This mode is definitely more technically demanding and can provide a better viewing experience, it will give the player an advantage in close-quarters combat. As for the benefits of third person, third person mode is generally considered an easier mode because you have more foresight and can play defensively. This view, if anyone is favorable to the game, will feel more secure because it can observe a lot of space, it is difficult for the opponent to attack because you can use peripheral vision to detect. Depending on the situation, the player can switch these two views easily.
        <br>In addition to PvP and PvE modes, our game is always based on a story mode, which will guide the player throughout the gameplay. We've designed a story-driven quest system that can be completed step-by-step, and it will help players acquire the necessary equipment and items for your character. As mentioned, the plot will always lead the player from the very beginning, after receiving your character has completed all the basic equipment such as helmet, armor, pant, glove, boot and weapon, the tasks the storyline will continue. It will help your character reach a higher level and have resources to enhance the above equipment to prepare for more difficult modes.
        <br>For the "Free to Play" game genre that our team is developing, for long term growth we need support from in-game microtransactions. It will help create an economic system within the game community allowing players to pay a fee to earn in-game currency for a specific shop that allows them to purchase exclusive items and trade between each other. However, this will not affect the game balance because the microtransaction’s purpose in our game only allows players to purchase cosmetics, unlike other "Pay-to-win" games, microtransactions directly affects the character's strength and equipment causing imbalance in power between players. Currently we are developing this game on the PC platform, but in the future maybe we will develop this game on the Mobile platform as well. It will make our game more accessible to more people, because nowadays the number of people using smartphones is very high, so access to the Mobile market is something that will happen in the future.
         </p>

      <h4><b>MOTIVATION</b></h4>
        <p> We are aiming for an open world sandbox game like Minecraft but the plot is more interesting and detailed. A Dungeon-based game contributes to making players have a more realistic feeling about the game. Players will follow the main story of the game to be able to level up and encounter mobs with higher difficulty. At the same time, gamers will get rarer and quality gear after each level. With Unreal Engine, the game will become more realistic with 3D images, interactive effects with high image quality and smooth motion. In addition, the game engine can also handle sound effects, lighting effects, physical impact effects, and build artificial intelligence (AI) to control the actions of the characters in the game to increase the enjoyment of the game. In order for us to develop the series further, microtransactions are very important and this is also our main source of income. Loot box, Gacha, Battle pass are forms of microtransaction that we are currently focused on. We are currently developing this game on PC and if it is successful, gamers will see this game on mobile platforms.
        </P>

      <h4><b>LANDSCAPE</b></h4>
        <p>Since our project was based on the games such as minecraft, rust and borderlands there is no doubt that we will have a difficult competition. We are similar to minecraft with the mobile version of the game. However, in minecraft you would not be able to bring your progress from the pc to the phone, we believe that this is a flaw that we can capitalise on to differentiate ourselves. Since our game is mmorpg, we would want to continue making characters stronger rather than restarting and doing the same quests. Our environment design and mob designs would be similar to Rust and Borderlands rather than minecraft, since the timeline of our game is set in a post-apocalyptic world. We also take ideas from borderlands having different classes in their game, with the idea of upgrades available as you level up. We will make sure that our classes differ from borderlands so that no one would feel like the character classes are similar and are rather different, which is another point we would have to carefully develop in order to gain competitive advantage.
        </p>

      <h2>Plans and Progress</h2>
        <p>Project is to develop an action role-playing hack and slash game on the PC and mobile platforms although we all wanted to create different games. We believe that this would be more suitable as a project to start our game development skills as developing a console game would require more experience and time. We want our main game to be played on the PC as our target audience would be ranging from kids to young adults rather than kids. In addition, due to the nature of the game requiring players to invest several hours of their time in order to progress, it would be ideal for them to do it behind the comfort of their own leisure time. Furthermore, because the game requires players to forge and scavenge for items in order to build a base and equipment in order to survive, we have decided it would be beneficial to them to be able to do that on the phone as well. To elaborate, if a player were to wait 1 hour in order for his item to be crafted but he is away from his computer for 8 hours due to work, during his free time at work he would be able to collect the item and craft a new item from his phone, in order for him to feel like he can progress on and away from the computer.
        <br>Moreover, ‘mobile games are easy to develop using out-of-the box engines like Unity or Unreal.(Roesner n.d ,para. 10. )’. Another key point to why it would be easier to develop a mobile game is due to its low barrier to entry. This is shown as the ‘mobile apps market (includes all apps, not only games) is the most saturated market with more than 6,000 apps published every day on Android alone’(Roesner n.d ,para. 11.). This is evidential as depending on the size of our app, it would take us 6-7 weeks to develop and alpha test it if it was a small app but it would take us 20-22 weeks for a bigger app. On the other hand, developing a console game would take several years and could not meet our audiences’ expectations. Such a case occurred with the game Cyberpunk 2077, which took about 9 years to develop only to flop.
        <br>Being able to release an app in less than a year would be significant for our learning and careers. Not only will it force us to use our skills learned, but it allows us to get feedback on our project. The feedback allows us to reflect on what we did well and what needs improvement. Another course of action that would help us in our career path and contribute to our project is research. Researching what apps have succeeded and failed and how it occurred will allow us to make smarter decisions and avoid mistakes when developing our project. Another way that could also benefit our project and learning is through interviewing people who have had experience in app development and who have either succeeded or failed.
        <br>Furthermore, there is the rising trend and controversial topic of people being addicted to their phones. This is more prevalent in the younger age group of kids and adolescents, as a report has shown that ‘30% of 10-year-old Spanish children have a cell phone; the rate increases to nearly 70% at age 12 and 83% at age 14.(Gutierrez, Fonseca, Rubio 2016, para.10.).’  The data supports our project of developing a mobile game as it would be more likely that the kids and teens would be our main audience as it’s most likely they would be playing games on their phones rather than adults.
        <br>Our passion for going forward with this project stems from our love of video games and curiosity of technology. We’ve come to the age where we are able to take part in the industry and we are also at a point where all the information we need is at the palm of our hands since all the information we need can be researched on the internet.
        </p>

        <h4> Week 1: </h4>
           <p> The first stage to creating a large scale project, such as developing a video game, should always be focused around building an effective project plan and a roadmap outline of how we plan to develop this proposed product, with details of when each section should be completed, and what to move onto once we have completed tasks. Each team member will likely possess a different set of skills than each other and will therefore be suited to different jobs, which will also be assigned to each person during the planning stage. Each team member's skills should be recorded, so that if there is a specific problem during the development stage, our team members will know who may give them the best assistance.
            <br>For our project, we plan to develop an Openworld, sandbox, massively multiplayer online roleplaying game (MMORPG), based in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Players will have the option to play as 1 of 4 player classes to roam the map, complete quests, collect items and defeat waves of enemy monsters in a hack and slash styled combat archetype. Players will be able to connect to each other's character servers, or join raid event parties to participate in online boss raid events. However, MMORPG games have been exceedingly popular ever since the first major hit ‘Meridian 59’ was released in 1996, and games that have been put on the market have gone unnoticed by the gaming community. This is a scenario our team hopes to avoid by highlighting popular trends that have caused other games to gain success within the gaming industry that follow a similar MMORPG / sandbox structure to the blueprint we are planning. By taking successful elements from these games, we can hope to create a product that the community will respond to immediately. Once our team has agreed on the outline of our game, we can begin to create a mood board, using existing game examples to help visualise our ideas, and create a road map plan to illustrate the timeline for the project's development, from the planning stage to the end exhibition.
            <br>After initial discussions, our team decided that we are most interested in building a 3D Open world based, sandbox style MMORPG based in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, following a similar retro style graphics style to games such as ‘Rust’, ‘Mad-Max’, ‘PlanetSide 2’ and ‘Borderlands 3’. The Term ‘sandbox’ defines an element of gameplay that gives the player a great degree of creativity to complete tasks towards a goal within the game, or build new structures to suit their own goals. Sandbox games have been known to be hugely successful in today's modern gaming age, with title examples such as Minecraft making headlines and top-chart ratings since its release in 2009. Although the player will have a more limited ability to manipulate their environment compared to Minecraft, players will still need to collect resources and build new items and resources to help them survive the wasteland night. The player will create a character using 1 of 4 different classes: The human class will be the baseline class for players who are looking for a baseline experience, using a variety of melee and ranged weapons to deliver high amounts of damage per second (DPS). The battle droid is the upgraded version of the human class and will include a deployable turret tool with higher HP and Damage stats, but will lose points in movement speed. The Tinker class is a ranged spell caster, focusing on wiping out waves of enemies with high damage Area of Effect (AoE) abilities. Finally, the Doctor is the supporting class, able to heal and buff allies around them. These classes will determine the character's playstyle, as well as the user's role in collaborative online play. The player will work their way through the wasteland, collecting items to upgrade their characters, and complete quests that will be available across the map. Our game will not force the player to follow any specific direction, but will include storyline quests the player can complete in order to unlock new enemies, items and areas of the world map. Our game will utilize both 1st and 3rd person character view ports which will be interchangeable by the user. Giving the player choice between using a 1st and 3rd person viewports will give the player more interaction variety with the world around them, using 1st person views to build objects or fire arrows more accurately at distant enemies, or the 3rd person view to inspect their characters armour or fight large waves of enemies that surround them effectively. This interchangeable player viewport system has been utilized in other extremely successful games of a similar genre, such as skyrim: Elder Scrolls V.
            <br>The wasteland inspired map will be populated by procedurally generated enemies that the player will have to defeat in order to gain experience points used to level up and purchase/ upgrade class abilities, collect items and resources, and complete quests. Our product will include a range of different enemy classes, the most common of which being wasteland gangs, teams of AI controlled enemies that roam the wasteland in search of resources. These are highly aggressive, territorial groups that will not hesitate to strike up a fight with the player on sight, using a variety of melee and ranged weapons. Undead zombie styled minions will also roam the map, easy to defeat alone, but can often be found in huge groups that will easily overwhelm the player, these enemy mobs walk slowly and have a generally low population throughout the wasteland during the day, at night their hunger is increased, and they will run aggressively towards anything they can consume. At night, mutant enemy insect-human hybrids will burrow out of the ground and consume the wasteland, killing anything they come into contact with (including other AI controlled enemies). These mutants avoid sunlight, and can be found in caves and abandoned mine tunnels scattered throughout the world, their hives normally guard high-level bosses, as well as unique rewards. Finally, the game will include large scale enemy battles with Mythical Bosses, bosses that have existed for thousands of years in the world our players will inhabit, but must be summoned by specific relics and spells that the player will have to find / complete before they can fight these bosses. These bosses will be huge, and difficult to defeat, similar to the base gameplay style of ‘Dark Souls 3’, or ‘BloodBorne’, and will drop unique equipment, armour set pieces and resources for players to collect. Our product will also include purchasable DLC content, as well as purchasable loot boxes the player can purchase using money to instantly gain 3-5 items depending on the box-size, the money from these purchases will become profit for us developers and can be used to invest in the further development and maintenance of the game.
            <br>Our team believes that this game will be best suited for an audience of 16 years and above as it contains a high amount of violence and graphic content, it should not be recommended for ages younger than this as the content may not be appropriate for them to view. 16 year old teenagers are the ones normally to enjoy this genre of video game the most, as they are normally looking for an escape from their daily lives, and have fun defeating hordes of enemies with their own character that has been designed and promoted by them.
            <br>Inorder for this project to succeed our team will have to have general knowledge of the steps and processes of game development, to create character skeletons, textures and animations to be implemented into the game, as well as knowledge of 3d environment creation through the program unreal engine 5 and unity. Our team will require access to high performance computer hardware, to ensure we can always produce the same quality of work.
            </P>

        <h4> Week 2: </h4>
          <p>In the second stage, we use sandbox as an art style. Game Sandbox is a genre of video games characterized by creative elements when allowing players to freely roam around in a virtual environment to do whatever they want from the approach to the quests, NPCs or the way to complete the quests main and side.
            <br>Usually, Sandbox games will be combined with other game genres to add more fun and uniqueness to the gameplay. The most popular are still open-world Sandbox games, giving gamers the freedom to move, develop and improve the world to their liking. When it comes to Sandbox, many people will have confused with the mechanics of dream world games. Open world games are simply a type of game where players in the virtual world have no restrictions on movement. But for Sandbox games, gamers can influence to create anything in the game world, or in other words, in Sandbox games, you are a god who creates everything in the game.
            <br>In order to make the game more friendly and attractive, real locations will be recreated in the game from map design to forests or deserts. For example, about jungle sections, we will design the forest same as the Amazon forest.Next, the desert, we will take inspiration from the Sahara desert, one of the largest and most extreme deserts in the world.Moreover,allowing players to explore is also something we are considering to include in this game. Exploring real mysterious places in the world will stimulate players' curiosity and at the same time not make them get bored with this game because the more they go, the more they will discover new things and find more items to upgrade their character.
            <br>As we all know, making a game is not an easy thing, at least in the past years. But in the past 5 years, the video game industry has developed extremely strongly, in which there is a huge contribution from game making tools, such as BUnity, Corona SDK, SpriteKit. , Build Box, Construct 2, ... And one of the tools mentioned here is the Unreal Engine from Epic Games, which I consider to be the most professional in today's game making tools.Firstly, Unreal Engine delivers the ultimate experience, smooth and easy to understand, in the form of drag and drop, editing objects, UE brings seamless and logic in the game making experience.In addition, there are many features such as:Mobile, Blueprints, Tools, Source Code, Marketplace. Secondly, Multi-platform support, from Window to MacOS, Linux, Android or iOS, HTML5, PS5, Xbox... all are supported almost completely with Unreal Engine.After the above great things, Unreal Engine is released completely for free by Epic Games, a brand that is too familiar to many people. You get to use it for free, and only pay 5% of every $3000 your game earns, meaning you only need to pay when your product is successful.After all that, I think Unreal Engine will be the best choice for us to make this game.Before playing this game, we will have to meet the requirements to be able to play this game smoothly.
          <br>
          <br>
            <b>The minimum requirement of the computer to play this game includes:</b>
              <ul>

          <br>

        <h4> Week 3: </h4>
          <p>Once week 2 is done and we have designed some concept art to help the development process of the environmental design and character design. The next process is to further expand on the ideas and concepts that we have discussed in the first week. This would include the detailed lore and mechanics behind the characters, enemies and bosses that we have added in the game. Since the player has to choose a class when creating a character, we would need to adjust each class with base starting stats and equipment. To elaborate, if we were to implement the class of a mage, we would need to give that class a starting stat of 10 intelligence, 2 strength, 3 agility and 1 vitality. To justify the stat distribution, a mage would typically be a character that is very knowledgeable and can cast powerful spells but are rather fragile and weak, which explains the 10 intelligence and 1 in vitality. As a result, when players progress in the game and level up they would earn stat points. This allows them to add points in one of the four stats in order to make their character more powerful. This would be a crucial mechanic in the game as it forces players to balance the stat distribution, as if they were to dump their points in the intelligence stats, they would be very powerful but very weak. On the other hand, if they dumped their points in the vitality stat then their mage would be very durable but weak in fighting, hence why they need to evenly distribute the stat points in order to minimize their characters weakness while optimizing strengths. Another game mechanic we are working on is making each enemy act differently based on their design. To further explain, we have made a group of enemies the scavenger gang. Based on the name of the group, the mechanics we will implement in those enemies are that they will never attack you alone as it would benefit them to attack enemies as a group as it is stated in their name, they are scavengers. Roaming the map as a group would allow them to scavenge loot more efficiently. Although they travel in groups, they are not that powerful but while fighting you they would always try to steal some items from you, therefore we can add a game equipment or ability that the player can acquire later on in the game that would prevent his items from being stolen.
         <br>Creating unique characters and environment is definitely a factor that can help our project stand out but it won’t be possible if it doesn’t make sense. That means the story telling has to be able to explain any questions the player would think of while playing the game. The game environment that we want to develop is based on games such as rust, borderlands and mad max. This means that the environment takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, where half the population was able to leave earth and further advance civilization while the other half had to remain and survive with whatever was left for them. The way the game story will develop will be through narration and character dialogue as the players progress through the main mission. The narration will be done at the beginning describing the setting of the environment and how it came to be to peak the player’s interest. The character dialogue will be between the player and the NPC. The NPCs act as an important role in the game as they are the one who give you the quests of the game and would tell you why you need to take on these tasks. Through these explanations is where you are able to learn more about the different characters, bosses and environment of the game. This process should take a long time for us to  meticulously work on these details as these are the main factors that dictate the success and failure of the game, but in the case that we are able to get this done in a week, at the fourth week of the project we will start to build a prototype for the game.
          </P>

        <h4> Week 4: </h4>
          <p>In this 4th week, we'll be designing a game blueprint, which includes parts like character models, textures, interactions, animations, and lighting. Besides, we will also mention the software for game development as well as the hardware requirements of the game. First of all, about the character model as mentioned above, our game includes 4 character classes: human class, battle droid class, tinker class and doctor class. For each different class, the appearance will be different so that players can choose according to their preferences. First, the human class by using 3D images to create characters that are quite similar to the appearance of real people, according to the nature of the character, this is a quite flexible and powerful character. That's why we designed a character with a well-proportioned body that is neither too fat nor too thin. The outer part, the character will wear leather or canvas costumes when not in battle mode, while in battle mode, the character will put on full body armor equipped with weapons. Secondly, about the battle droid character class, this is a character class quite similar to the human class, with high resistance and damage but the ability to move is quite slow. That's why we designed a character with a big and bulky appearance and this character will carry cannons with him. The third is about the tinker class, this is a character class that favors long-range damage and low stamina. Based on those characteristics we have drawn a character with a petite appearance, and carrying with them a weapon that is the scepter. Finally, the doctor class, for this class, the character will have a similar appearance to the tinker class because these are all objects with low resistance and both use magic, so the tinker class also will use scepters as equipment.
          <br>About the texture of the game we used many different tools to complete, first to mention bloom, this is a tool that helps us adjust the intensity of light sources in the game such as the sun. We have carefully calibrated this tool to create a realistic lighting environment that does not cause discomfort for users. Tessellation, this tool helps to add detail to surfaces and objects in the game world. This method helps to calculate information and increase the depth and complexity of objects. Shadow quality and shadow distance with these two tools improved the quality of shadows on objects. Finally, the depth of field- feature of this tool is similar to portrait photography on smartphones. It helps players to clearly define what is in front of them and will blur the surroundings behind.
          <br>As for the character animations, we've built a highly responsive and natural synchronization system between body parts. Responsiveness is important in competitive games because any movement that takes place can cause the player to crash into obstacles or be killed by enemies. To achieve this we have combined various features of animation to get a complete animation Continuous Animation, with this feature we created a loop of animations to have a continuous movement of the character. another pretty important feature is turn animation, it appears pretty much in all games, with this feature we allow the character to rotate 180 degrees in a frame we apply this animation and animations can show a complete change of direction and show when the character changes direction, starting in a direction opposite to the character's forward vector and ending in a forward direction equal to the character's vector. Moreover, we also use sub-animations, to fix the rendering of some asynchronous motion above the current animations. When showing momentum on my body I use them in different situations without interrupting the player to show different animations. For example, we will animate the environment around the character such as the ground. The player can continue to attack or run without having to stop after the player falls and touches the ground.
          <br>In addition to the above features, in order for players to have a smooth game experience, we have created a highly interactive system because of the ability to interact with the in-game world, which is a detail that makes the game genre. We have created a pulse player-to-human (NPC) and human-environment interaction system, an example of this is now with AI support that players can chat with NPCs more naturally, who can ask NPCs what the state was like that day or what the weather is like. And an example for the interaction between the player and the surrounding environment, when faced with different weather conditions, the character will have different expressions. When faced with unexpected light sources, the character will feel dazzled and will cover his eyes with his hands or when in cold conditions and if not kept warm enough, the character will have expressions such as shaking. Although only with small details, they have contributed to helping people have a feeling of authenticity when playing the game.
          <br>For software and hardware requirements, for software, we used Unreal Engine to build 3D graphics, images and characters. Along with the use of C++ and Python programming languages to create game databases. About the required configuration for the game, because this is a game with 3D graphics and high capacity. So not all textures can be compatible with the game. GPU: Core i7 7700k, 16GB RAM and SSD. And it is necessary to have a screen that can meet the game graphics to be able to feel the truth in the game about the screen requirement of 240Hz refresh rate to ensure a good experience for people. For an open world MMORPG game genre, a world is large and needs high detail and perfection, so it will take up a lot of time and money to develop. It can take more than a year to perfect the details in the game and funding is a big barrier for us to be able to complete it. To overcome this, we will spend time calling for capital from investors, after getting the capital, completing the game is only a matter of time.
           </p>

        <h2>Roles</h2>
          <p>Roles will definitely be crucial in order for everyone to have a chance to work on the specific field work that would help them pursue their ideal job in the IT industry. However, because everyone’s ideal job is related to some sort of development job, such as web, UI or game development, no roles should be assigned. The whole team should work together as the workload of the project comes from developing the app itself. To elaborate, if Aiden wants to be a UI developer and Nhan and Dat want to be web developers, they could work together on the game UI in order for them to gain experience in developing a UI, which is useful in web design and game design. Although Gary hasn’t specified what part of the game development he wants to work on as his ideal job, he should contribute equally to all parts of the project in order for him to see and understand each step of the game development so that he can decide what exactly he wants to do. Therefore, every step of the process in the project should be contributed equally by everyone as it would be beneficial for everyone to understand what is required to do in each step of the process to widen their career options in the IT industry.
          </P>

        <h2>Scope and Limits</h2>
          <p> It is true that “There’s no such thing as perfection” as stated by Peter Jackson, therefore in order to reduce our margin of error it would be crucial for us to be able to identify the scopes and limitations of our project. What we expect to be presentable in the given timeframe would be a basic playable game that allows you to at least do some missions, level up, fight monsters and interact with other online players, what we cannot promise all features that we believe would differentiate us from the competition and justifying features such as microtransactions. Other limitations that we will experience is the lack of game development experience and guidance, because we are a group of 4 University students where some of us have or do not have experience in game development, we will not be efficient. This is because those who do not have experience would end up putting more time into learning how to use the game engine and other softwares rather than efficiently advancing the project.
          </P>

        <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
          <p> Before the team can start to develop the game, we would need to invest in a desktop or laptop, depending on whether we want to work from home or anywhere. Due to our game being a 3D game, our investment in a PC will not be cheap. We do not want to invest in the minimum requirements depending on software requirements but we do not want to spend so much on the higher end components, therefore we would need to buy parts that are in between in order for the PC to benefit us in the long run. The graphics card would probably be a GTX 1080 as it is what most people run their desktops on, and it is strong enough to process details such as shadow and effects. Although a Core i5 is minimum for a processor, we would instead invest in an Intel Core i7 7700k  as it would make rendering faster and more efficient. In terms of RAM, we believe that at least 16GB of ram in order for us to multi-task such as open several software or web browser tabs. Other parts also required would be a SSD in order to have a lot of space to store data. The choice of monitors should also be considered, preferably a dual monitor setup. However an alternative to that is buying a wide monitor as well would be able to do the same such as the 49” Samsung Odysse G9 LCD Monitor LC49G95TSSEXXV DualQHD 240Hz G-Sync Curved Genuine. Finally, the peripherals will not matter much such as keyboard, mouse and mousepad. As stated earlier, we want to make a build that would last us for at least the next 5 years before we decide to reinvest in a stronger build.
          </P>

        <h2>Testing</h2>
          <p>It is common for game developers to have alpha and beta testing when developing a game. As stated by the economic times ‘alpha testing is a type of testing that is done on an application towards the end of a development process when the product is almost in a usable state’(The Economic Times, n.d. para.1.). This step is usually done before beta testing. Beta testing ‘is one of the customer validation methodologies to evaluate the level of customer satisfaction with the product by letting it be validated by the end users, who actually use it, for over a period of time’(Software Testing Help 2021, para. 4.). This means that after alpha testing, we would need to have a marketing plan done and started by the time we are alpha testing, this is also known as game trailers. Game trailers will allow us to show snippets of our game in order to peek at their interests. Once that is done, we can sponsor famous streamers to play the beta game or distribute them fairly by having them sign up to receive a code and have access to it. This method allows us to gain end user’s feedback in order to find flaws in our games and determine where we can improve and what we can add on before official release.

        <h2>Risks</h2>
          <p>There are several risks that the team will face throughout the project from beginning to end. The first issue we should be aware of is malware. A malware is a ‘software that fulfills the deliberately harmful intent of an attacker’(Moser, Kruegel, Kirda 2007.para 1.). There are several different types of malwares such as trojans, ransomware and spyware. They all harm our computers differently but they all have the same intentions of being ‘a major threat to the security and privacy of computer users and their data’(Moser, Kruegel, Kirda 2007.para 2.) In order to protect ourselves from malware, we would need to have an Antivirus in our computers. But if we want to save costs then we would need to do research about how to protect ourselves from malware. Moreover, as mentioned saving cost would be crucial for our team. On top of having the possibility of paying a subscription in order to have access to the software if it is required, we would need to have funds in order to market our game. Furthermore, as mentioned there are a lot of applications on an app store and many of them are similar in terms of functions such as entertainment, learning or shopping. As a result, if we want to gain our audience’s attention and have them use our app, we would need to be able to stand out. Differentiation should be one of the main focuses for the project to succeed. Once more, market research would be crucial, reading reviews of similar apps would be required to identify consumer needs, likes and dislikes so that we would avoid mistakes done by previous developers.
          </P>

        <h2>Group Processes and Communication</h2>
          <p>Communication between group members is arguably the most important aspect of your project. Past experience has shown that communication breakdowns between group members are the most common cause of project failures, so it is vital that you specify at the outset the means and expected frequency of communication between group members. How will your group communicate? How often will meetings take place? Will these be face-to-face, or using technologies such as Skype? Or Facebook? Or email? Or text? Or ... ?? What will you do if you have a group member who does not respond to communications? You should expect contact between group members at least once a week outside class times (i.e. apart from lectures and tutorials). You can always make contact more often if you wish, but you do need to know what minimum frequency is expected from all members of your group.
          <br>In society, collectivization in both work and study is always an optimal trend, it is possible to gather the brains of group members to accomplish a certain goal. Therefore, communication in a group is a crucial skill to help us establish close relationships between group members.Sometimes there will be times when you find it difficult to express your thoughts, ideas, or get stuck when finding a direction to implement for a group meeting. This is not an easy skill, but if you want your abilities to be recognized and appreciated, you should believe in yourself, not hesitate to propose new ideas even though the results may not be as expected at first. But at least you don't become an "invisible ghost" in your own group.
          <br>In addition, the teamwork process is also important because it includes the techniques you use to motivate and resolve conflicts, as well as how you bring about change in your team, how you initiate start and use interactions, the interventions you use to bring about cooperation in your team, and the interventions you use to bring about teamwork in your group. In my opinion, communication is also a part to help get an effective group process in a project. When working together, having good communication helps everyone know how to support each other. If you work in a good team, you will find yourself improving. You will get maximum support, learn a lot of good things from everyone. Moreover, if you communicate well, it will help people inspire each other when discussing, working
           </P>

        <br>

  <h2 id="skills"> Skills and Jobs </h2>
    <p>  One of the risks that was discussed was the risk of malware or hacking. If someone is successful at hacking our system, it would create setbacks due to blackmailing or loss of data. Therefore, one of the job positions we should be looking for is a security developer. Their job description would be ‘create systems, methods and procedures to test the security of software systems and fix security flaws.’(Technojobs, n.d) The required skills would be knowing scripting languages such as python or coding languages such as C and C++. Therefore, the end goal for a security developer is to ‘ethically hack systems to discover their vulnerabilities.’(Technojobs, n.d)
    <br>Another important role that is needed is a marketing manager. Their role is important to deliver the project because they would know the different strategies we could use to market the project while minimising expenses. We would probably hire someone who has had at least 3-4 years of experience in marketing and that has specifically worked in the IT industry, this is to ensure that they know what kind of product they are trying to sell to which customers.
    <br>Although we are supposedly the team manager, it would be in our best interest to hire a tech project manager, who also must have at least 4 years of experience in the field. Not only will he be able to become a mentor to use, since we are new to the industry but we will be able to ensure that the team productivity is efficient. He will be responsible for a lot of the duties such as brainstorming, project planning, scheduling and designating tasks and managing the budget. Of course he will not be making all the decisions as he would also have to consult with us about it to make sure that we agree with his plans as it is still our project that we need to develop.
    <br>Finally Hiring a game developer is also essential to our team. Since our project is to develop a game, there is no better option than to hire one that should also have more than 4 years of experience in game development. This is so that he can give us feedback on the ideas of our games, giving us insight on which games he has worked on that have succeeded or failed based on what features. Furthermore, it would make the development process of the project much more efficient having a leader and an expert in the development field working together. Of course, the game developer should be fluent in programming languages such as C, C++ , Swift and Java in addition to being familiar with game engine softwares such as Unity and Unreal.
     </P>

  <h2 id="peer">Peer feedback</h2>
    <h4>NHAN</h4>
      <p>In a short period of time, our group came up with this project and from my perspective, this is a  good and potential project that could be developed in the future. Sandbox and MMORPG have been  popular and both are one of the most attractive gerne from the very beginning in the gaming industry. Despite having no experience in developing games, we based on our knowledge from the course, our experience as a gamer and our passion with IT, which made this project. We described the game as specific as possible, based on our idea. We know that we are just University students with no practical experience, so our project might have some mistakes. To be more specific, in terms of user's experience, we did not have so much to say. From the user's viewpoint, they may have another response and reaction that could not be predictable. For the reason I mentioned above, in the section Timeframe, in week 14, we planned for beta testing in order to make up for a lack of understanding user’s experiences.
      </p>

    <h4>AIDEN</h4>
      <p>This project has given me the opportunity to think creatively about a large-scale project that would normally be outside of my field of knowledge, that may be possible to pursue one day, or to serve as an example of how a project like this could be accomplished. Personally, I love video games; and the idea of game conceptualisation, development and publishing really excites me, and I hope to oneday pursue a project like this professionally. I had a great time conceptualizing ideas with my teammate Gary, thinking about possible worlds and realities in which to build up an entertaining environment for players to enjoy around the world. As we share similar interests within the subject, it was easy to develop our ideas, and mutually agree on a direction to begin developing. Although we are a team of 4, a couple members failed to contribute to the project's conceptualisation, research and planning stages; they were able to complete their tasks and bring good work to the table whilst we developed our team's project report. My work focused on the projects conceptualisation, research and report development as well as producing the Tools HTML section of our groups assignment.
      </P>

    <h4>GARY</h4>
      <p> There is no arguing that communication is one of the major factors that determine whether group work is done successfully or not. Looking back at how this project went, there is no doubt that there was a lack of communication, which led to several obstacles in order to finish the report efficiently. However, everyone managed to contribute some work even though it was not done equally. As a business student, it was a very good assignment for me to utilize my business skills acquired in my 3 years of attending the university. This includes conceptualizing the project, doing research on the competition, differentiating our product to the competition and finding several ways of marketing our project. I believe that this project has helped me identify the skills required and issues that I may face in the future when working on a similar project depending on what field I end up following for my career. This is because I did most of the report writing throughout the week with little help from my group members other than Aiden who equally put in as much time as I did while building the website for the team. In addition to communication issues, what was really lacking in the group was a leader, we didn’t assign a leadership role to anyone. This also contributed to the inefficient pace of work. In the end, we managed to finish the group report on time and had a realistic assessment of the contribution, which we managed to discuss and agree on.
      </P>

    <h4>DAT</h4>
      <p>During this semester, we came together and worked on a project together. This project sounds very potential because it hits the interest of a certain number of players (especially gamers who like Sandbox and MMORPG). Everything went well at the beginning such as being able to choose or give opinions on the project and agree with each other's opinions without any issues. As a freshman, I have almost no experience in coding or making games, so I don't have many ideas about making a game. However, I feel that each member of the team did a great job. Then things got complicated, I had some technical issues with teams. To be specific, I didn't have access to teams but I let everyone know. Everything else is excellent. In short, it all stemmed from the fact that I lost connection with Teams so it's my fault. And I'm sorry about my lack of contribution, I d

  <h2 id="group"> Group reflection </h2>
    <h4>AIDEN</h4>
      <p>Our team members were able to agree upon, and work towards a mutually fulfilling goal without dispute. We all share video games as a pastime and agree on some of the best classics that are available on the market, making it easy to decide on the elements in which we thought made a good game. I thoroughly enjoyed conceptualizing and researching possible elements with my teammate, and long time friend, Gary and hope to one day be involved in a large scale development project like the one we have begun to describe. However, I feel that our other team members Dat and Nhan, could have participated more in the concept and research stages of our project's development. Without any of their contribution, our project was limited to the creativity of 2 out of the 4 available individuals, and if everyone had contributed an equal amount, we would have an even better development plan than the one we have created. It surprised me how much time goes into game development, and the amount of planning it takes before even being close to having a schedule, before any of the game's design elements can begin. From this assignment I have learned how to coordinate efficiently with my peers, and chase people up on work that can be improved when they are not replying, i have been a part of a number of teams during my time at RMIT and have often found that everyone has their own lives with their own problems, i have my own as well. But I put a limit on not replying to team mates inquiries, the way I witnessed my teammates blatantly ignore Gary's questions to them. I hope that Dat and Nhan that teamwork doesn't mean dividing the work up into stages, everyone has to participate at every stage of a team project, and it can be a really fulfilling experience, provided the time is put in equally.
      </P>

    <h4>GARY</h4>
      <p>Looking back at the project, I believe that I was lucky to have had Aiden who is someone I have known for quite a while even before attending RMIT. This allowed for the conceptualization of the project to be a smooth process as we both enjoy playing video games. However, I would argue that it was also a difficult process as there was little to no input on the project idea from Nhan and Dat, therefore Aiden and I could not just start writing without knowing if that was the project they wanted to work on as it would only be fair to have everyone agree on the project. Unfortunately, it took quite a while for Dat and Nhan to get back to us, but once they did, we were able to work on it. Throughout the project, there was a lot that could be improved specially from Dat and Nhan, there were a lot of communication issues between them and I. Multiple times they have ignored responding to my messages, which made it difficult to rely on them. I admit that it was unreasonable for me to start writing a lot of the project, but with their lack of communication and cooperation I don't believe we could have been able to finish it in time. Aiden worked on the website by himself, which i give him a lot of credit for as we went a designed a website that exceed my expectations, not only that but he was very courteous and communicated to me whenever he wasn’t able to complete his part in time and would require for time for him to do so. Due to the lack of equal contribution in the work, we had a group meeting where we all agreed that Aiden and I would get 100% contribution points while Nhan and Dat would only get 40%. Although I don't believe it is deserving, I can't disregard the contribution to some work, which we are using in the report. There were a lot of surprising things I learned in this project mostly related to game development such as the required amount of time needed. What surprised me the most though is whenever I was communicating with Nhan and Dat, every single time I would enquire about why they were ignoring me they would never give me a reason, even up until now I still don’t know why. I don’t believe that there is anything I learned about group work other than setting ground rules is essential. If only I communicated my expectations, things could have been different. But, I don’t believe that I have to be responsible to tell someone how to think, the guideline and instructions are on canvas. Overall, the project was a very interesting project to work on specially with Aiden’s ideas of the game, the only thing that needs to be improved is the cooperation and courtesy of Nhan and Dat, they can’t even apologise for their lack of cooperation. I hope they realise how important communication and being courteous is when it comes to group work, because saying I don’t know anything or that you are a freshman, doesn’t entitle you to anything. If you don’t know just ask, I am not a mind reader and will not know what you do and do not know.

    <h4>NHAN</h4>
      <p> All the members of my team agreed to build a sandbox game empire, an open world MMORPG, a game genre that could grow worldwide and attract a large number of players. As for the contribution to the project, I agree that Aiden and Gary are the two people who contributed almost all the ideas for this project, they came up with the idea for the game and built the skeleton. As for me, I haven't been able to contribute many ideas to them, but I always complete the writing tasks and the things they give me before the allotted time. After this project I knew I needed to improve my communication because during the meetings I didn't communicate much with my teammates, so I didn't give much feedback on the project. And one thing I learned after this project is that I need to learn to work more as a team and communicate with my teammates more so that everyone can understand each other better.
      </P>

    <h4>DAT</h4>
      <p>All members of my team agreed on making a sandbox game combined with an open-world MMORPG. Each member of the team is working towards a common goal, which is a good sign. However, the lack of contribution at the beginning, made it difficult for the whole team to come up with new ideas. During the work, I felt that there were many mistakes that I could fix. Those were the lack of contributions to the group and communication skills. After this project, I think I should contribute more as well as give more ideas to make the team run as smoothly as possible and there are many things I need to learn from the teammates.
